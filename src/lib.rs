//! A collection of some useful tools (functions, types, traits, macros).
//!
//! **Crate Features:**
//!
//! - `cfg-if` (enabled by default): enables the [`cfg-if`](https://docs.rs/cfg-if/0.1.7/cfg_if/) crate and re-exports its `cfg_if` macro (which somehow appears as if it were declared in this crate)
//! - `either` (enabled by default): enables the [`either`](https://docs.rs/either/1.5.2/either/) crate and re-exports it and its `Either` type (which somehow appears as if it were declared in this crate)
//! - `either_use_std`: enables the `use_std` feature of the `either` crate
//! - `no_std`: enables no_std compatibility, removing the `vec_zip` module and the `hashmap` macro
